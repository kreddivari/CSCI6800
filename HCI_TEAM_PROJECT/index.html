Patient need to have a prior knowledge about computers and need to actively listen for the computer instructions. As some of the patients already have vision difficulties, it is difficult to see the screen and follow the computer instructions.
As computer need to save all the vision profiles of many users, it is difficult to maintain the data and there are security concerns in various aspects. However, the manual process is time consuming it is very interactive. One can be clear of any doubts instantly
and as discussing about their health issues regarding vision, they could get immense satisfaction.

				 They were comfortable with the advanced user interface and understood the suite of possible functionality offered to them. 
				 All users were able to follow the computer instructions and could easily go through the automated process.</p>

			  <h4>Design Overview:</h4>			 
              <p>We have decided to provide quick tour about hoe to use the machine for first time users.When user select start  icon on the dashboard screen machine starts the actual process.
			  user will be bring to the phase 1 which is giving personal information.After providing the personal information user will be navigated to phase which consistes of machine instrectios and hard ware interaction.
			  After detailed vision check process,user can access the report options where user can choose print and exit or email and exit or continue to glasses vending phase.In the phase 3,user will have options to select the perticular frame type and match with his facial image.when the user confirm the item,will be taken to payment screen where user need to choose any payment options out of several and make payment.As soon as the transaction number and receipt genarated the machine vend the glasses. 
			  .</p>
              <h4>Illustration of the Design:</h4>  
<p>This design consists of 3 mandatory phases.User need to go through the process accordingly from start to end.User donot have an exit or skip from one phase to another phase.The design is more interactive and takes longer times than expected time in the requirement.This time is very suitable for the users who has more time at the airpot terminals.
		  .</p>			  
              <h4>User Scenario:</h4> 
			  <p> Mr John Doe forgot his glasses and he has 14 to 20 hours of flight journey and he would like to read some books.With out the proper glasses eading a book is difficult to him.He has morethan 3 hours to his departure,he is willing to go through the quick guide of the machine and willing to start the process.
			  From the user’s perspective, this design is much more useful for those who have enough time at the airport. As this category of user has enough time, he/she can do some selection on available frames by selecting and changing the glasses untill it matches them.Once the user is happy about his selection he can buy the glasses of his choice and range.
Advantages</p>
			  <h4>Advantages:</h4>
<p>Since the design has more information, It is good for those who willing to know more about the process.
✓ The clear explanation and details of the vision check process is given.</p>			  
			  <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>   
			  <p> The user cant skip any one of the phases through out the process,the user gets confused while going all of them.
✗Since the design will need many phases to go around, the transaction will take much more time to be done.
✗ The design is complex internally.</p>
<h4>Degree to Which Design Met Requirements:</h4>   
			  <p> The design did not meet the requirements as expected before when designing started. The design seems to be precise, but not in practice.</p>

			  <h4>Design Overview:</h4>			 
              <p>We have decided to provide a quick process for vending the glasses.When user select start  icon on the dashboard screen machine starts with "EHR" information.
			 User need to provide the Electronic health record identification number so that system will retrive the health information about the user.
			 The process is very simple.When ever user enters the EHR number,user will be bring to the glasses vending process which again consists of selecting the right frame.User donot need to provide the personal onformation as the system retrives all the needed information about user with the help of EHR.But user needs to confirm the authentication to accept the machine to retrive the information about the user.
			  
			  In the process,user will have options to select the perticular frame type and match with his facial image.when the user confirm the item,
			  will be taken to payment screen where user need to choose any payment options out of several and make payment.As soon as the transaction number and receipt genarated the machine vend the glasses.

<p>This design consists of 2 mandatory phases.User should go through the process accordingly from start to end withiout skipping any phase. user need not to enter any information unlike the phase 1 and phase 2 in the Design 1.System is able to retrive all the neccesary information about the user.
This design is very suitable for the users who are in rush to get the glasses instantly the airpot terminals.
		  </p>			  
              <h4>User Scenario:</h4> 
			  <p> Mr John Doe forgot his glasses and he has no time and needs the glasses instantly.Since he has very less time to his departure,he is not willing to go through the design 1 and and willing to start the process right away.
			  From the user’s perspective, this design is useful for those who have not enough time at the airport and who is in a rush.
			  user can quickly provide the EHR information and select the frame and slight measurements and get the glasses vended quickly.
			  As this design also fits to the users with shorter time.Once the user is happy about his selection he can buy the glasses of his choice and range.

			  <h4>Advantages:</h4>
<p>Since the design is quicker for user to skip any phase 1 and phase 2, It is good for those who are in a hurry or less time to take the whole process.
✓ User just need to give tthe authentication access to retrive the information about him saves user more time.</p>			  
			  <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>   
			  <p> The user should have prior knowledge about what is EHR and where do he finds the number as not everyone remembers his EHR number and doesnot carry any document 
			  related to EHR especially at the airports.
